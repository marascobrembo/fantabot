"""Everything a plan needs, assembled once. The one place the value model is built.

Three commands — `asta optimize`, `asta live` and `asta bid` — each repeated the same
fifteen lines: read `quotazioni`, read the observed clearing prices, read the sentiment
feed, then derive the pool, the club map, the name map, the value model and the legality
matrix. A fourth copy lived in `tests/integration/test_asta_engine_db.py`'s `_world()`
helper, which nobody had counted.

**Why that mattered rather than being untidy.** They drifted. `asta bid` was still
planning on plain `fvm` after `asta optimize` had moved to the sentiment-adjusted model,
which meant the command that spends real credits and the command that says what to spend
disagreed about what a player was worth. On plain `fvm` that loop would chase Yildiz to 62
credits with a metatarsal fracture reported by three sources. A walk-away is "what is he
worth to us", so this is the last place in the repo where the planner and the bidder may
differ.

**The factory seam survives, and is not an accident.** `reservation.rolling_advisory`
takes `value_of: Callable[[], ValueModel]` while `reservation.reservations` takes a
`ValueModel` directly. `asta live` supplies the callable; today it returns one snapshot,
because `feed.ledger_events` materialises the whole ledger before the loop starts and
there is no "later" during which a fresher reading could arrive. The seam is what a
genuinely live `asta live` will need, so `PlanInputs` exposes both the model and a factory
over it rather than collapsing the difference.

**Split in two on purpose.** `build_plan_inputs` is pure and takes rows; `read_plan_inputs`
is the two-query shell over a `Session`. Validating `--sentiment-run` stays in the CLI,
because it raises `typer.BadParameter` and nothing in this package may import typer.

Both queries sit in the shell rather than behind helpers in the modules that reduce their
rows. `expected_prices` used to live in `prices.py`, with its repository import inside the
function body — so `prices.py` read as pure to a reader and to a grep while reaching
Postgres on every call. Keeping the reads here means the layer a module belongs to is the
one its imports say it belongs to.

    as 8x500, which is our room, so nothing looked wrong — and `docs/fantalab/00 §13` is
    explicit that a rule written into the code is a bug, because the next asta is the
