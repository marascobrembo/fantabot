"""The plan world, derived from rows. Pure — this module reaches no database.

Split out of `asta_planner` so the import graph says what the docstring always claimed. The
two queries stay there; only the derivation lives here.

**Why the split is load-bearing rather than tidy.** `read_plan_inputs` imports `AsteRepository`
inside its body, and `tests/_importgraph` counts function-body imports on purpose — that is
where three real violations were hiding. So anything sharing a module with it reaches
`adapters.persistence`, and so does anything that takes one of its types. The live-room tracker's
one structural guarantee is that it cannot reach Postgres; taking a `PlanInputs` defined next to
a repository import would have made that guarantee unprovable.

    """Derive the plan world from two already-read tables. Pure.

    Takes rows rather than a `Session` so the derivation is testable without a database,
    which is what lets the golden harness drive it from fixtures.

    **`excluded` is dropped before anything is derived**, not filtered out afterwards.
    Half of it would be worse than none: `format_roster` reads `names`, the opponent
    tracker reads `roles`, the optimizer's variance term reads `teams`, and a player left
    in any of them surfaces as a name with no row behind it. It also has to happen before
    `build_value`, because the sentiment normalization pins the *pool* mean at exactly
    1.0 -- a player who cannot be bought must not move everyone else's multiplier.

    `prices` is deliberately not filtered. It comes from a different table and cannot put
    anyone back: the pool is what gates selection.

    **`callable_ids` is the same drop for a different reason.** `excluded` answers "someone
    decided not to buy him"; this answers "he cannot come up for auction at all", because
    FantaLab's listone does not carry him. Measured 2026-09-01: 41 of 570 pool players are
    absent from it — Lukaku, Nkunku, Morata, Perin, Angelino among them — and the optimizer
    put three in the plan. In a simulated mid-auction state Lukaku was the *top* walk-away of
    all twelve targets, so the headline target was a player who could never appear.

    An allowlist, not a difference. `pool_ids - set(bridge.values())` is the obvious spelling
    and it is wrong: `listone.parse` keeps fantacalcio ids as `int` while pool ids are `str`,
    so the subtraction removes nothing and the whole pool would be excluded. `None` means no
    filtering; an empty collection means the bridge resolved nothing, which is a real failure
    and empties the pool rather than quietly passing everyone through.
