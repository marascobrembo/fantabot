"""`fantabot auth fantalab-login` — sign in once, store the session encrypted.

Same posture as `login.py`, and for the same reason: **the sign-in is never
scripted and no page is ever clicked.** A scripted credential entry is what gets
accounts flagged, and FantaLab offers Google and Apple sign-in besides its own
form, so there is no single flow to automate even if we wanted one.

What is new here is what must *not* happen. Spike S3 established that FantaLab
keeps `refresh_token`, `id_token` and `access_token` in `localStorage`. That is
what makes a capture possible at all — Playwright's `storage_state` reads
localStorage and not IndexedDB — but it also means writing that state to a file
would put three credentials on disk in the clear. So no `storage_state.json` is
produced, not even a git-ignored one: the values go from browser memory through
Fernet into Postgres with no plaintext stop in between.

Everything checkable is checked before the browser opens. A password typed into
a real browser is expensive to waste on a missing key or a stopped database.
