"""The harvest commands: scan, collect, load, backfill — and FantaLab sign-in.

Lifted out of ``cli.py``, which had grown to 951 lines with two thirds of the
growth from this one phase. They belong here for a better reason than size: the
rest of the CLI drives *our* leagues on leghe.fantacalcio.it, while these five
read a different site for training data, and nothing is shared between the two
but the console.

Registered rather than decorated, because ``app`` lives in ``cli.py`` and
importing it back would close the circle. ``register`` runs last there, so
these five now list together at the end of ``--help`` rather than interleaved
with the league commands — the one visible difference the move makes.

**Import-light, like its parent.** Every body imports what it needs when it
runs. ``cli.py`` imports this module at start-up, so a module-level
``sqlalchemy`` or ``playwright`` here would land in every ``fantabot --help``
— which a test in ``test_db_boundary.py`` refuses.
