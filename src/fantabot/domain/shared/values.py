"""Value types shared across the read side. Pure: no I/O, no SQLAlchemy.

They live here rather than beside either consumer because both the repository
that produces them and the source that serves them need them, and importing
either from the other would be a cycle.

``PriorStats``, ``BiasRow`` and ``PlayerQuote`` arrived for the first, and by the worse
route: each was defined **twice**, in ``adapters/persistence/scraping.py`` and again in
``application/pricing.py``, and the two copies had already drifted -- the repository's
``BiasRow`` carries a ``delta`` field the pricing copy never had. Nothing caught it
because nothing tested the pricing model at all. Same shape as ``SCORES`` below, which
had three copies of one ordering.

``QuotazioneRow`` arrived for the second reason. It was defined in
``db/repositories/reference.py`` and named in the signatures of ``news.build_pool``
and ``asta_engine.build_plan_inputs`` — both pure functions, both consequently
importing the repository module to spell their own arguments. A ``TYPE_CHECKING``
guard hid that from the interpreter but not from the design: a function whose
parameters are written in terms of a repository belongs to the repository's layer.

``SCORES`` is the single definition of the eight model-produced scores. It had
three copies before this module existed — ``news/store.py::_SCORES``,
``news_sentiment.py::SCORES`` and ``db/models/sentiment.py::SCORE_COLUMNS`` —
which is three places for the order to disagree.

**There is no stats-source interface here, and that is deliberate.** A ``StatsSource``
Protocol — ``projected_scores`` / ``player_pool`` / ``target_price`` — used to sit beside
these types, declared against a per-matchday provider that was never chosen. It went with
the Classic lineup scaffolding it was written for (``lineup.py``, ``auction.py``,
``strategy.py``): an interface with no implementation and no caller is a guess about a
shape, and this one had been guessed three phases before anything would consume it. The
asta engine does not need it — it prices from ``quotazioni.fvm``, the observed clearing
prices in ``asta_assignment`` and the sentiment feed, none of which that Protocol
described. When a per-matchday source is picked, the interface gets written against the
consumer that exists at the time.
