"""The exact set of commands the CLI exposes, pinned by introspection.

**Why not by parsing `--help`.** `tests/test_cli_entrypoints.py` does that, and it
has to — its subject is that two *ways of invoking* the CLI agree, which is a
subprocess question. But its regex takes the first word of every boxed row, and a
boxed row can be an option description: it reports 18 commands, one of which is
`ledger`, a word from `asta live`'s help text. A check that hallucinates a command
cannot be the thing that tells you a command went missing.

Walking Typer's Click tree asks the question directly, and reaches nested groups,
which a flat help page does not show at all. That matters from here on: the CLI is
being reorganised into sub-apps, and this list is the single constant every step of
that reorganisation edits — so a step that silently drops or renames a command fails
here, on the line that names it, rather than in whatever runs it next.
