"""The pure half of the plan world, in a module that reaches no database.

`PlanInputs` and `build_plan_inputs` lived in `asta_planner.py` beside `read_plan_inputs`,
which imports `AsteRepository` in its body. `tests/_importgraph` counts function-body imports
deliberately — that is where three real violations were hiding — so the whole module reaches
`adapters.persistence`, and so does anything that takes a `PlanInputs`.

That is fine for a command, which reads a database anyway. It is fatal for the live-room
tracker, whose one structural guarantee is that it cannot: hand it a `PlanInputs` and
`test_the_room_module_cannot_reach_postgres` goes red the moment the module is written, with
the fix discovered under deadline.

So the derivation moves here and the two queries stay behind. The split already existed in the
docstring's intent — "`build_plan_inputs` is pure and takes rows" — this makes the import graph
say it too.
